### Description

So to make things much simpler he bought another suitcase having same length, width and height, which is 20 inches. This measurement is taken from inside of the box. So a box which has length, width and height of 20 inches will just fit in this suitcase. He also decided to buy only rectangular shaped boxes and keep a measuring tape in his pocket. Whenever he chooses one gift box, which must be rectangular shaped, he quickly measures the length, width and height of the box. But still he canâ€™t decide whether it will fit in his suitcase or not. Now he needs your help. Please write a program for him which calculates whether a rectangular box fits in his suitcase or not provided the length, width
and height of the box. Note that, sides of the box must be parallel to the sides of the suitcase.
